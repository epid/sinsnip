h1. SinSnip - A simple code snippet manager

h2. Overview

This is my implementation of "NavySnip":http://github.com/navyrain/navysnip, a personal source code snippet repository.

I decided to reimplement the tool in Sinatra since it doesn't require the overhead of Rails and I want it to be *fast*.

I also used this project as an experiment with HAML and SASS. Plain CSS is used for the syntax highlighter...

It uses the "Sequel":http://sequel.rubyforge.org ORM with the "CodeRay":http://coderay.rubychan.de syntax highlighter.

h2. Dependencies

<pre><code>
  $ sudo gem install sinatra
  $ sudo gem install haml
  $ sudo gem install sequel
  $ sudo gem install coderay
</code></pre>

h2. Setup

All you have to do is run the server, the database is automatically created for you.

<pre><code>
  $ ruby sinsnip.rb
</code></pre>

Open your web broswer and visit "http://localhost:4567":http://localhost:4567 and click the "New Snippet" button to get started.

h2. TODO

* Click anywhere on the snippet preview to open the full view
* Implement a simple pagination layout (I think sequel has some support for this already)
* Implement a simple REST API for command line submission of content
